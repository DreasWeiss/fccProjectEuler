# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
[solution](./problem.js)
<br>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```
fiboEvenSum(10) should return a number.
Waiting: Your function should return an even value.
Waiting: Your function should sum the even-valued Fibonacci numbers: fiboEvenSum(8) should return 10.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(10) should return 10.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(34) should return 44.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(60) should return 44.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(1000) should return 798.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(100000) should return 60696.
Waiting: fiboEvenSum(4000000) should return 4613732.
